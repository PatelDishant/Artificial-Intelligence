Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Of BFS and DFS, which search algorithm yields the best results? (i.e. which is more likely
     to get the mouse to the cheese safely before being eaten?)
     
     BFS yields the best results and is more likely to get the mouse to the cheese safely before being eaten.

2 .- (1 marks) Does this mean that in general BFS is a better search algorithm? (yes/no and give reasons to
     support your answer based on your observations)
     
     Yes in general BFS is a better search algorithim. This is because the cost of the edges is the same for all nodes
     that can be reached, which means the order of expansion will lead to the optimal path. Whereas with DFS it's prone
     to looping infinitely because of back edges.

3 .- (2 marks) Describe the heuristic function you used for A* search. Why is this heuristic admissible?
     
     The heuristic we used to assign cost is calcuated by taking the Manhattan distance from (x, y) to 
     the closest cheese. The cost we compute is non-negative and is never greater than the true cost from
     the lowest-cost-path from (x,y) to the closest cheese.

4 .- (1 marks) Explain how your heuristic function accounts for the presence of multiple cheeses.
     
     Ranks the cheeses in terms of how close they are to the (x, y) location and select the closest one.

5 .- (1 marks) Is A* equivalent to BFS for this problem? or is it better/worse? explain your answer based on 
     your observations.
     
     No A* is not equivalent to BFS, it is better than BFS because in our search we expand on nodes
     that move the mouse towards the general location of the cheese, whereas BFS expands outwards in all
     directions, possibly expanding on more nodes than required.

6 .- (2 marks) Describe your heuristic function for A*-nokitty. How does it work? what factors are considered
     into the cost function? is it admissible (yes/no and why)?
     
     A*-nokitty builds a 2D array that represents the distance of each cheese relative to each cat. It does this
     by calculating the distance between point (x,y), each cheese, and subtracting distance between that particular cheese
     and each cat. It then selects the minimum value from this 2D array. Although the heuristic cost is always less than 
     actual cost, this heuristic is not admissible because there is a possibility of negative values.

7 .- (2 marks) What is the largest limitation of the search algorithms implemented in this assignment?
     (i.e. is there anything we are missing that could lead to a smarter mouse?) - this is
     a more or less open question, but we talked about it in lecture!

     It's difficult to find a balance between risk and reward. For instance, there can be a cheese near the mouse, but also 
     a cat near that cheese; in this scenario it is hard for our program to decide whether avoid the cat or get the cheese.

Mark with an 'x' where appropriate. If something is only working partially, briefly describe what works, what
doesn't work, or what problems exist.

Marking:

(5 marks) Correctly implementing BFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected search
          behaviour.

(5 marks) Correctly implementing DFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(5 marks)  A* heuristic function is implemented, reasonable,
           and admissible.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing A* search - the search
           runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(10 marks) Implemented a **clever**  A*-nokitty heuristic
           and a working A*-nokitty search. The search
           should produce a smarter mouse than all of
           BFS/DFS/A*.

           The heuristic should accounts for known game 
           factors that affect the mouse's chance of success.

           (to be marked competitively - smartest mouse
            in the class earns full marks)

(10 marks) Answers in this report file

(up to 15 marks) Assigned by the TA based on how smart your
		 mouse actually is. Mind what is going on in
		 the game, and think about how to make your
		 mouse most likely to win!
